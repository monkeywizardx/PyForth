# MonkeyForth
### A small Forth, implemented in Python.

This project was started some time ago, and it was terrible, going by the name of PyForth. I've reimagined it as MonkeyForth,
brought a linter, and started to work on a complete rewrite of the program.

### How to Use

To gain quick access to the monkeyforth REPL, just do as follows:
```
python monkeyforth.py
```
To run a file on a Linux computer:
```
cat <file> | python monkeyforth.py
```
To run a file on in the windows command prompt
```
type <file> | python monkeyforth.py
```

### Features

#### First major features
- [ ] Create the basics of the interpreter (stack, REPL)
- [ ] Add variable support
- [ ] Add an if statement.
- [ ] Add loops.
